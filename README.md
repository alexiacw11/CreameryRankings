# CreameryRankings
This was created for BYU's incoming freshmen who are interested in Statistics. Students and faculty participated in ranking twelve creamery flavors. Their rankings were submitted through a Google Form document and the data was automatically saved into a related Google Spreadsheet. This repository includes the 2024 data with participants' names replaced. 

In order to demonstrate that data to the students, an R script was prepared ahead of time! This script includes several different graphs, a t-test, and hierarchical clustering. To ensure these statistical concepts were more digestible for freshmen, the code was transferred to a short Quarto presentation. This presentation has fewer graphs than the original R script and opened discussion amongst students and faculty members. 

This was a fun activity that was hands-on all the while introducing students to the department and future skills they could acquire!
